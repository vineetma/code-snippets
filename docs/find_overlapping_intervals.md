# Find if points are overlapping

## Point is inside the interval
If value is inside the interval, than it will be greater one of the numbers from interval 
and less than the other one.
With this difference compare, both signs should be opposite

## Intervals overlap
if one of the values of an interval is contained inside the other interval it will 
definitely overlap
